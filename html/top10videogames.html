  	  	<h1>My Top 10 Video Games of All Time</h1>
  	  	<h6>By Lamb</h6>
  	  	<h6>Published April 27th, 2020</h6>
  	  	<h2>Introduction</h2>
  	  	<p>This is a list of my top 10 video games of all time, listed in descending order. For this list, I put a constraint on myself to put at most one game from a particular franchise on the list. For example, I cannot put both StarCraft I and StarCraft II on the list, since they're part of the same franchise. However, beyond that it was fair game (no pun intended). The list includes games from different platforms and different genres. For the "Platform," I put all the platforms for which the game released, and then put italics on the one I have played it on. If there's only one platform then I don't do that.

  	  	Thanks for reading!</p>

		    	  <p>I first discovered this game from my cousin when I was visiting in Pakistan, and it instantly caught my attention. I had never been exposed to real-time strategy games before, and the feeling of creating a huge army from scratch was something that really enthralled me. Not to mention the wide variety of civilizations to choose from and the campaigns that were based on real life events. Additionally, the fact that you could play with friends and family over LAN made it really exciting to play, and due to those reasons it deserves the number ten spot on this list.</p>

		    	  <p>I honestly can't remember when or how I got into this game, but it is probably the only game on this list that I've watched more than I've played. StarCraft II deserves a spot on this list not just because it's an intense, fast-paced RTS, but also because it introduced me to the world of esports. I remember watching one of the first professional StarCraft II matches live, and I was completely hooked. I watched tons of pro StarCraft II after that, and followed the scene very closely. There was even one time when I woke up at around 5am to watch a Proleague finals taking place in South Korea, and I just watched it from my bed on my mom's iPad. It was really an extraordinary moment.</p>
				  <p>The game itself is fun to play as well, and is in my opinion more fast paced and focused than Age of Empires 2. While AoE 2 consists of tons of varied civilizations, StarCraft II consists solely of three different races, each radically different from the other. Despite this, it manages to convey a sort of balance between the race, with no one race having a distinct advantage over the other. Therefore, you can choose the race which you like the most, which I think is really nice to have.</p>
				  <p>I also would like to mention the amazing campaigns in StarCraft II. I really liked the story in all the expansions, with Legacy of the Void probably my favorite. I just think StarCraft II is a really solid game overall, with a really intense pro scene. I honestly would have never gotten into esports without it.</p>

				  </div>

		    	  <p>Oh boy. CounterStrike: Global Offensive is by far my most played game on this list, and there are definitely good reasons for that. I was never much of an first-person shooter player, and getting into CS:GO was definitely a bit tough in the beginning due to my lack of experience with the genre. However, once I understood the basics behind the spray patterns of the different guns and how the gameplay worked in general, I was completely hooked. Deathmatch is still by far my favorite game mode (which probably explains why I never got out of Silver even after putting close to 600 hours into the game), but the bomb scenario mode is really interesting and involves using a lot of different tactics. It's just a fun game that you can just spend a ton of time on, and it's especially fun when playing with friends. In addition, I got to know about a lot of different esports personalities through this game.</p>

		    	  <p>There are so many things I could say about this game. Much like CS:GO, I had never been that big into the card game genre prior to Hearthstone. However, something about HS just clicked with me. I got into it from the beta, and I was instantly hooked. I love the art and animations in the game, along with the associated sound effects and voices of the cards. The gameplay is fast-paced and deep, with many different classes and cards to choose from. You can make a hyper offensive deck that aims to win the game quickly, or a more control oriented deck to gain board control for a long-term victory. You can choose whichever hero you like most, and take advantage of their unique ability. I remember bringing my mom's iPad to school when I was in high school just so I could play this game. I played it with friends and just have had a really good time with it. I also was introduced to a bunch of streamers due to this game, so it's been a great experience. I still play Hearthstone semi-regularly today, and I don't think I'll ever stop playing it anytime soon.</p>

		    	  <p>I've really only played a few Mario Party games, but MP8 has to be the best out of all the ones I've played. The boards are really unique, and the motion controls (while a bit annoying in some minigames) generally work well. I especially like the board that is loosely based off of real estate concepts, in which you have to invest coins into hotels to gain ownership and thus stars from the hotels. If you invest more than your opponents, then you gain control of that hotel. It's a really unique concept that I've never really seen in any other Mario Party game. MP8 is also probably the game I've played the most with my brothers, so I've had lots of good memories with it. While the previous four games are outstanding multiplayer experiences, Mario Party 8 just delivers on pure fun and excitement. For that, it definitely deserves the number six spot on this list.</p>

		    	  <p>I kind of remember how I first got into osu!. I think I searched up something like "games to play with your own music" and then randomly found osu!. As with many other entries on this list, I had never really gotten into rhythm games before. However, osu! was an extraordinary experience. Firstly, it has an absolutely gigantic amount of content, most of which is user-generated. While the music is heavily skewed towards Japanese music and anime intros, there is also a good amount of variety with other genres being represented as well. You can use a custom skin, download whatever beatmaps you want, play with other players, look at leaderboards for each beatmap, and so much more. I have made some strong friendships through meeting people over the game, and it's another one of the games on this list which I think I'll be playing on an off for a long time (even though my rank has just been decreasing over the past couple of years).</p>

		    	  <p>While I believe that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is currently the most complete Mario Kart game out there, I have to say that MKW is my personal favorite. Everything about this game was just so fun, the tracks were great, the soundtrack was awesome, and the introduction of bikes added some really cool gameplay elements. With bikes you could do wheelies which made you got a bit faster, and you could also drift inwards rather than outwards (which was the standard way of drifting for all of the karts). The game also included Funky Kong, which is a reason for it to be in the top five by itself. Just kidding, but honestly, when will Funky Kong come back in one of these big Nintendo games (like Mario Kart, Smash, or Mario Party)? I really liked how crazy he was, it was really funny.</p>

				  <p>MKW also got me into playing Mario Kart semi-competitively, and while I didn't really play in any tournaments or leagues, I reached a rank online where I would sometimes stumble upon teams practicing, and I was always astounded by how well they raced. Also, the game allowed for a variety of cool glitches, which made watching Time Trials of some tracks (Mushroom Gorge and Grumble Volcano instantly come to mind) really entertaining. I think the game was just really good fun, and while the item balancing could have used some work, it was overall really good and definitely my favorite Mario Kart game so far.</p>

		    	  <p>We have finally reached the top three of this list, and if I'm being completely honest each of these games deserves to be at the number one spot. However, only one can be number one, so I had to put them in an order. At number three I chose The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Honestly, I don't really have words to describe what this game means to me. The world is absolutely gigantic and beautiful, and you can explore every single part of it. The game starts with an opening sequence that shows off the vast world in the distance, and it's astounding to know that everything you see in that cutscene can be visited and explored to your heart's content. Since Link has the ability to climb basically anything in the game, you always have an opportunity to climb huge mountains and then soar off of them using your Paraglider, taking in the amazing views. There have definitely been some profound moments when I just stop and look around with the camera and just take in the sheer beauty of the world. The art direction in this game is unparalled, and don't get me started on the soundtrack.</p>

				  <p>When you're wandering around in the world, there isn't really any intense music playing. It's simply usually a calming piano tune, which really enhances the feeling of being lost in a huge open world. The various bosses have excellent themes that make the fighting exciting, and speaking of the fighting, the combat in this game is really varied and well done. There isn't a set way to do a fight, if you want to just use your bow and arrow you can do that. If you want to sneak up on enemies and kill them that way you can do that. If you instead want to use the objects in the environment to help you defeat the monsters, you can do that as well. The choice and freedom that the game lets you have in not only the combat but also in the exploration of the game, make it just an incredible experience, and also makes it so that you have lots of opportunties to replay the game in a different way as well.</p>

				  <p>I'm still playing on my first save file with the game since I'm trying to finish the DLC content now (which is amazing as well), but I have plans to play the game again from the beginning while having some self-imposed challenges (along with Master Mode, but I'm honestly a bit terrified of that mode since I'm not that good with the combat in this game). For example, I was thinking of playing through the game again without ever looking at the map, which I think will help me get lost in the world even more and also challenge myself to use landscapes to my advantage to find out where I am. I think that'll help me get better acquainted with the map because yes, even after over a 100 hours into the game, I still don't really feel like I can just pick two areas and be able to make my way between them without getting lost unless I look at the map. The world is just that big. There's an interesting GIF (https://imgur.com/t/zelda/6ro0m3w) which kind of shows the differences in sizes between the map in Breath of the Wild compared to other games in the series, and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim as well. Apparently, the world in BOTW is 1.66 times larger than Skyrim, which is kind of crazy to think about. While it may not rival the vastness of games like The Withcer 3 and the incredible experiences of games like Red Dead Redemption 2 and Horizon Zero Dawn (I haven't played any of those games but am just basing this statement on stuff I've read online and opinions from my friends) it was my first proper open-world experience, and I'm super excited to see what Breath of the Wild 2 has to offer (hopefully we can actually go underwater and fishing in that game!).</p>

		    	  <p>Oh man. Metroid Prime. What a game. This game is probably the closest a video game can get to perfection in my opinion. It was the first Metroid game I completed, and it just blew me away from start to finish. Metroid games are unique in that their style of gameplay is inherently non-linear, which means you can explore lots of areas right from the start. Metroid Prime was the first time I had been exposed to that kind of gameplay, and it was really cool. But before I get into all that, I need to talk about the controls I had when playing this game.</p>

				  <p>I played Metroid Prime as part of the Metroid Prime Trilogy on my Wii U. Therefore, I used motion controls for the game (pointed the Wii Remote at the screen to aim, used the Nunchuk to move, etc.). I think that that control scheme makes Metroid Prime (and the other Prime games) the most immersive experience I've had in a video game. That includes the VR games I've played as well. It's really hard to explain, but there's just something about moving your arm in real life and having Samus move her arm in the game, looking around and knowing that whatever you see, Samus is also seeing. You really embody Samus and experience everything she does, whether it be intense battles with bosses that tower over you, a calm walk through snow filled areas, or anxiety inducing areas which are filled with darkness. I think this immersion is one of the core strengths of the Prime series, and it's the main reason why I highly recommend playing the Trilogy versions of the first two Prime games (however, I should add that I haven't actually played the original GameCube versions of the Prime games, so I'm not sure if they're better or worse).</p>

                  <p>I would like to talk about the music in Metroid Prime a little bit. Each track in the game is, in my opinion, a masterpiece. From the calm, exploration inducing vibes when you land on Tallon IV to the pure anxiety which is the Omega Pirate boss theme, every track in this game is able to convey something emotional. I have much of the soundtrack saved on my phone, and frequenly listen to the boss themes from the Prime games when exercising or driving. They just make everything so much more intense. I just absolutely love the soundtrack in this game, and the other Prime games as well.</p>

                  <p>The art in the game is phenomenal, and still holds up so many years after the game's release. The design of the areas each have their own feel to it, with Phendrana Drifts being a more serene area and Magmoor Caverns being more volatile and dangerous. The Phazon Mines just oozes of danger and really makes you feel alert at all times. Each boss design is unique and has tons of personality, and it's really extraordinary when fighting against them. The final boss in particular just blew my mind when I saw it. Fighting against the final boss was probably one of, if not the most epic experience I've had in boss fight in a video game. I don't want to spoil too much about it, but it was just amazing.</p>

                  <p>It's really difficult to come up with words to explain how much I love this game. I just can't wait for Metroid Prime 4, because I can't wait to explore another world (or worlds) with Samus. Just thinking about what the areas will be like, what the bosses will look like, and what the music will sound like fills me up with excitement. Metroid Prime made me firmly into a Metroid fan, and the fact that there are two other equally as good games after it in the Trilogy just adds icing to the cake. It definitely deserves to be a top three game for me.</p>

		    	  <p>Pokémon is my favorite video game franchise of all time, and my favorite game in that franchise is Pokémon Emerald. Thus, it's at the top of this list with confidence. Emerald is probably my most played Pokémon game of all time, and there's no question why that's the case. Once you complete the epic story and become the Champion, the game allows you to enter the Battle Frontier and then you realize that the depth of the battling system is just unbelievable. To be able to completely finish the Battle Frontier takes a huge effort and lots of time, and that's just a bit of the post-game that's involved in Emerald. However, I'm not sure why I'm talking about the post-game before talking about the actual game, so let's get started with that instead.</p>

				  <p>Emerald is essentially the same as Ruby and Sapphire but enhanced and perfected. The story is radically different from both games, with the player having to infilitrate not just one team's base but both Team Magma and Aqua. I really liked the teams in this generation. While they had completely different aims, the leaders of both teams realized what they were doing at the end and admitted that what they were doing was wrong and that their actions had consequences. I think that was a nice way to end the story as it showed the human side of the leaders.</p>

				  <p>The soundtrack of this game is really good. Generation 3 had arguably my favorite soundtrack of the series, and also introduced the iconic Battle Frontier Brain theme (which was done really well in Generation 4 and probably is one of my favorite themes across all video games). However, I never actually got to listen to those themes in Emerald, due to the sheer difficulty involved in reaching the Frontier Brains. That tells you a lot about the time you needed to invest to do well in the Battle Frontier, and why I was sorely disappointed when it did not return in Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.</p>

				  <p>Some people could complain about how much water there is in the Generation 3 games (I'm looking at you IGN), but I think the water parts are really nice. I honestly like water areas in most video games, and in Pokémon the water areas are places in which you can freely roam around and access island which you can't access otherwise. Also, in Generation 3, you can use the move Dive to access more of the sea underwater, and that is used in the story as well. Water travel is honestly pretty fun in these games, and it makes sense that there's a lot of water as compared to the amount of land due to the the story as well.</p>

				  <p>Each Pokémon in this game is really memorable, and I can more often than not instantly recognize a Generation 3 Pokémon if you randomly show me one. I also like the assortment of legendaries in this game, from the big ones like Rayquaza to the roaming legendaries like Latios and Latias. Also, although Deoxys isn't really obtainable in Emerald, it is probably my favorite Generation 3 Pokémon.</p>

				  <p>There's just a lot to be said about Emerald, and I really do think it is the most complete Pokémon game out there. It has a great region with varied landscapes (including forests, caves, deserts, seas, underwater areas, etc.), really creative towns (Fortree City comes to mind), a unique storyline, memorable Pokémon designs, and an expansive post-game rivalling that of the Generation 2 games and their remakes. I think I started really getting into Pokémon because of Pokémon Emerald, and I've made some great friends due to Pokémon. Most of my obsession from Pokémon can be linked back to Emerald, so it'll always have a speical place in my heart. For those reasons and the things I've mentioned before, it is without a doubt the greatest video game for me personally.</p>
